The developing of the Android app refers to the "first line of code", ISBN 978-7-115-43978-9, which is a well-known Chinese textbook on writing Android programs. The basic framework of the app refers to this book, especially the use of Listview and Adapter and the design of user interface.

I was also responsible for the development of an Android app in 2018-2019 school year, Software Engineering Project, XJCO2913. At that time, I also referred to this book, therefore, the app of Final Project and the app of SEP has similarities in coding style and interface style. For example, the login function, there is not much difference between the two projects.
